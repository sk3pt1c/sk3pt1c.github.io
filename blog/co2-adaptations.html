						<h1>Physiological Adaptations to Elevated CO₂ in Freediving and CO₂ Tolerance Training</h1><br>
						<br>
						Freediving exposes the human body to extreme levels of carbon dioxide (CO₂) due to prolonged breath-holding. Over time, specialized training leads to biological adaptations that allow divers to tolerate higher CO₂ levels and delay the urge to breathe. These adaptations span the blood’s buffering systems, the neural control of breathing, oxygen transport in the blood, cellular metabolism, and cerebral blood flow. Below, we discuss each of these adaptive mechanisms and highlight peer-reviewed findings from the last decade that shed light on how the body adjusts to hypercapnia (elevated CO₂) in the context of freediving and CO₂ tolerance training.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Buffering and Acid-Base Regulation</strong><br>
						<br>
						One of the first lines of defense against rising CO₂ is the bicarbonate buffering system in blood. When CO₂ accumulates during a breath-hold, it combines with water (via carbonic anhydrase) to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) and H⁺ ions. An efficient buffering system will soak up H⁺ and mitigate drops in pH. In trained freedivers, the body’s capacity to buffer acid appears enhanced, helping maintain a near-neutral blood pH even as CO₂ climbs. For example, an arterial blood gas study in 2018 by Rizzato et al. (Frontiers in Physiology, 2018; DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.01558) found that during a 40-meter breath-hold dive, arterial pH remained stable and bicarbonate levels showed only minor changes, despite significant CO₂ retention. This minimal change in pH indicates that excess CO₂ was largely buffered by HCO₃⁻ and other blood buffers. Indeed, pre-dive techniques like hyperventilation can elevate blood pH (acute respiratory alkalosis) and increase buffering reserves, which freedivers often use to their advantage.<br>
						<br>
						Over longer periods, the body can also adjust bicarbonate levels to cope with chronic or repeated hypercapnia. In clinical models of sustained CO₂ exposure, the kidneys conserve bicarbonate and even additional buffering systems come into play. A 2022 experiment by Buchholz et al. (Journal of Applied Physiology, 2022; DOI: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00407.2022) subjected animals to moderate chronic hypercapnia and observed an upregulation of buffering capacity alongside a blunted ventilatory response  . Notably, prolonged CO₂ exposure led to recruitment of “extrapulmonary” buffering mechanisms to help neutralize excess CO₂ . This suggests that with repeated hypercapnic bouts (as in CO₂ tolerance training), the body may enhance not only blood bicarbonate stores but also other buffering routes (e.g. transcellular ion exchange or CO₂ storage in tissues) to protect against acidosis. Consistent with this, ingesting extra bicarbonate (as sodium bicarbonate) prior to breath-holds has been shown to extend breath-hold duration by buffering more CO₂ – an ergogenic effect demonstrated in controlled trials (Sheard et al., Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine, 2007) where breath-hold time increased ~8–9% with bicarbonate loading. (Sheard et al. 2007 is slightly older but underscores the principle that improved buffering capacity directly enhances CO₂ tolerance.)<br>
						<br>
						In summary, freedivers develop a robust acid-base regulation. CO₂ accumulation is countered by an increase in blood bicarbonate and other buffers, limiting the drop in pH. This acute buffering response is evident even in single breath-hold bouts, and training likely sharpens it further. Over time, the kidneys and other systems may “reset” to a slightly higher baseline bicarbonate level, analogous to acclimatization seen in chronic CO₂ retention conditions, thereby blunting the acidosis stimulus from any given CO₂ load.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Desensitization of the Respiratory Center (Chemoreflex Adaptation)</strong><br>
						<br>
						The drive to breathe is largely governed by chemoreceptors that sense CO₂ (and H⁺) in the brainstem and oxygen in the carotid bodies. With training, freedivers exhibit a reduced chemoreceptor sensitivity to CO₂, meaning their respiratory center tolerates higher CO₂ before triggering an overwhelming urge to breathe. Recent research has documented this blunting of the hypercapnic ventilatory response in apnea-trained individuals. For instance, Arce-Álvarez et al. (Frontiers in Physiology, 2022; DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2022.894921) reviewed evidence that divers and swimmer-apnea athletes have significantly decreased central CO₂ chemoreflex sensitivity compared to untrained controls. In other words, the brain’s respiratory center in these athletes becomes less responsive to the accumulating CO₂/H⁺ signal, allowing them to endure higher arterial CO₂ levels without reflexively gasping for air. Arce-Álvarez’s group showed that young trained swimmers had a blunted carotid body response to low oxygen as well as a blunted hypercapnic drive at rest, relative to non-divers (Arce-Álvarez et al., Front. Physiol., 2021). This desensitization of both peripheral O₂ and central CO₂ chemoreflexes is a key adaptation enabling longer apnea times.<br>
						<br>
						Laboratory studies of chronic CO₂ exposure support the idea that the ventilatory control system can “reset” to tolerate elevated CO₂. In the 2022 animal study mentioned above, prolonged moderate hypercapnia caused a sustained suppression of acute CO₂ chemosensitivity (i.e., the normal increase in ventilation in response to high CO₂ was dampened)  . Notably, after 1–2 weeks of CO₂ exposure, the subjects’ ventilatory response to additional acute CO₂ challenges was markedly reduced – a clear sign of respiratory center acclimatization (Buchholz et al., 2022). This mirrors earlier findings in humans: classical studies (prior to the last 10 years) have long noted that elite breath-hold divers often have low ventilatory responsiveness to CO₂. Recent data confirm this in modern athletes – for example, a 2017 study by Bain et al. found that among elite free-divers performing maximal breath-holds, the sensitivity of ventilation to CO₂ was very low and did not predict their breath-hold duration (it was the lung volume that correlated instead). Together, these findings indicate that CO₂ tolerance training leads to neuroplastic changes in the central respiratory network, effectively raising the CO₂ set-point that triggers breathing. High CO₂ levels that would provoke discomfort or panic in others are tolerated with relatively less ventilatory drive in trained individuals.<br>
						<br>
						Mechanistically, several changes may underlie this chemoreflex adaptation. In the brainstem, central chemoreceptor neurons (e.g. in the retrotrapezoid nucleus) might down-regulate their receptor sensitivity or be influenced by higher baseline bicarbonate in the cerebrospinal fluid after repeated exposures. The carotid bodies may also adjust via reduced neurotransmitter output or increased inhibitory modulation during chronic hypercapnia. Interestingly, animal models suggest that peripheral and central chemoreflexes can adapt synergistically – stimulating one over time can dampen the overall drive. In breath-hold athletes, both components appear to adapt: a 2021 study found that trained divers had a 20–30% lower ventilatory response to CO₂ and hypoxia at rest compared to non-divers (reductions that parallel those seen in diving mammals). This down-tuning of chemoreflex sensitivity is beneficial for extending apnea, but it comes with careful balance – the body must still respond when CO₂ or acid reaches truly dangerous levels. Freedivers train to recognize and manage these limits consciously, since their automatic CO₂ alarm is essentially set to a less sensitive threshold.<br>
						<br>
						In summary, chronic hypercapnia exposure through apnea training desensitizes the respiratory center. The result is a blunted hypercapnic ventilatory response – a hallmark adaptation in freedivers. This allows higher CO₂ levels to accumulate before triggering involuntary breathing movements, thereby prolonging the breath-hold. (Importantly, this adaptation requires careful training; an untrained person should never forcefully ignore CO₂-driven urges, as that can lead to loss of consciousness. Freedivers pair this blunted drive with discipline and monitoring to avoid hypoxic blackout.)<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Hemoglobin Affinity and Oxygen-Carrying Adjustments</strong><br>
						<br>
						Freedivers not only train their bodies to tolerate CO₂, but also to optimize oxygen usage. A key factor here is how oxygen binds to and dissociates from hemoglobin in the blood – which is influenced by CO₂ levels and other factors. The Bohr effect is the physiological phenomenon where an increase in CO₂ (and the resulting drop in pH) causes hemoglobin to reduce its affinity for O₂, thus releasing oxygen more readily to tissues. This is highly relevant in freediving: as CO₂ builds up during a long breath-hold, the Bohr effect helps unload oxygen from hemoglobin to the starved tissues. A recent review succinctly noted that in freedivers, high CO₂ at the end of a dive means the blood can deliver more O₂ to tissues like the brain because of the Bohr shift  . In essence, the rising CO₂ itself assists in oxygen delivery – a useful compensatory mechanism to prolong useful consciousness.<br>
						<br>
						Training does not appear to fundamentally alter the Bohr effect (which is a property of hemoglobin), but freedivers do develop hematological adaptations that enhance O₂ transport and CO₂ carriage. A notable finding published in 2023 by Kjeld et al. (Frontiers in Physiology, 2023; DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2023.1305171) showed that elite breath-hold divers have a higher hemoglobin concentration at baseline compared to matched controls  . This likely results from repetitive exposure to hypoxia triggering erythropoietin (EPO) release and spleen-mediated blood packing over years of training. A higher hemoglobin mass means more oxygen can be carried in the blood and also more CO₂ can be buffered (since deoxygenated hemoglobin binds CO₂ and H⁺). Interestingly, the same study found no significant difference in 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) levels in red blood cells between divers and controls  . (2,3-BPG is the molecule in RBCs that reduces hemoglobin’s O₂ affinity; higher 2,3-BPG causes a right-shift in the O₂ dissociation curve.) Earlier hypotheses suggested that apnea training might raise 2,3-BPG to facilitate oxygen offloading , similar to high-altitude adaptation. But the evidence from Kjeld et al. (2023) indicates that freedivers rely on normal physiological Bohr effect during dives rather than any chronic change in hemoglobin’s intrinsic affinity. In their study, the Bohr effect magnitude was comparable in divers and non-divers when tested in the lab, despite the divers having greater hemoglobin concentration  . Thus, the adaptive strategy in humans is to increase the quantity of hemoglobin (and circulating red cells) rather than altering hemoglobin’s binding properties.<br>
						<br>
						Another adaptation related to hemoglobin is the role of the spleen. Trained divers often exhibit an enhanced “splenic contraction” response during apnea – the spleen (which stores a reserve of red blood cells) contracts and injects additional RBCs into circulation during a long breath-hold. This boosts the hematocrit and O₂ carrying capacity acutely. Over years, repetitive splenic contractions in training may even enlarge the spleen (as observed in some diving populations) and improve baseline red cell volume (Ilardo et al., Cell, 2018, studying the Bajau diving people). Human elite freedivers have been measured to expel ~100–150 mL of packed red cells from the spleen during maximal apnea, raising hemoglobin by several g/dL temporarily  . This is an acute adaptation during each dive, but facilitated by long-term training of the dive response. More red cells in circulation not only carry more oxygen but also buffer more CO₂ via the Haldane effect – as O₂ is extracted, deoxygenated hemoglobin can bind more CO₂. This interplay means freedivers can both deliver O₂ and accept CO₂ in the blood more effectively at the end of a dive.<br>
						<br>
						In summary, while the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin in freedivers is not fundamentally changed, the conditions under which hemoglobin operates are optimized. High CO₂ and H⁺ during apnea (Bohr effect) ensure maximal O₂ unloading when it’s most needed . Training leads to higher hemoglobin levels (polycythemia) and a powerful splenic contraction reflex, both of which increase the blood’s gas-carrying capacity  . These hematological adaptations complement CO₂ tolerance by making oxygen delivery more efficient during hypercapnia and by providing greater capacity to buffer CO₂ in the blood.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Cellular and Metabolic Efficiency Adaptations</strong><br>
						<br>
						At the tissue level, freediving training induces changes that allow organs to function under low oxygen and high CO₂ conditions more efficiently. A major goal is to prolong aerobic metabolism and limit anaerobic fermentation during apnea. By staying aerobic, cells continue producing CO₂ (from oxidative metabolism) but avoid producing large amounts of lactic acid, which would otherwise rapidly accumulate H⁺ and CO₂ when buffered. Several studies in the past decade have revealed that elite freedivers develop remarkable adaptations in their muscles and possibly in their brain metabolism to achieve this.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Skeletal muscle adaptations: Kjeld et al. (2018, 2021) examined muscle biopsies of elite apnea divers and found elevated myoglobin concentrations and mitochondrial densities, akin to adaptations seen in diving mammals like seals  . Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein in muscle that provides an O₂ reserve and helps maintain aerobic metabolism when blood O₂ is low. Increased mitochondria and oxidative enzymes mean the muscle can generate the required ATP with less anaerobic contribution. In fact, the muscle of trained divers showed a higher oxidative capacity and fatigue resistance in low O₂ conditions, similar to adaptations in seals that dive for long durations (which have high myoglobin and enzyme levels) . This improved oxidative capacity allows divers to utilize the available O₂ extremely efficiently and delay the onset of anaerobic glycolysis (and the concomitant CO₂-producing bicarbonate buffering of lactic acid). The result is a lower accumulation of lactate and H⁺ for a given dive duration. A 2021 study by Kjeld’s group noted that elite divers had 50% lower muscle lactate accumulation at a given level of hypoxia compared to untrained individuals, indicating superior metabolic control (Kjeld et al., 2021 – cited in Front. Physiol. 2023). In summary, muscles become more like those of endurance athletes or marine mammals, adapted to extract the most energy per O₂ molecule and thus minimize additional CO₂ production from anaerobic sources.</li>
							<li>Cellular buffering and pH stability: Muscle cells of freedivers may also upregulate intracellular buffers (like proteins, phosphate, and carnosine) to neutralize any H⁺ produced. While specific studies on freedivers’ muscle buffer capacity in the last 10 years are sparse, analogies from high-intensity training literature (since breath-hold divers often do CO₂ tables that stress acid-base balance) suggest an increase in muscle buffer content. This would help in soaking up H⁺ within muscle fibers, delaying acidification. Any H⁺ that is buffered intracellularly does not immediately generate CO₂ (since CO₂ is produced when H⁺ is buffered by bicarbonate in blood). Thus, higher muscle buffer capacity could directly reduce how quickly CO₂ appears in blood for a given anaerobic output. Although direct evidence in freedivers is limited, this is a plausible adaptation to repetitive apnea-induced acidosis (similar to how sprint training increases muscle carnosine).</li>
							<li>Metabolic rate suppression: Through practice, freedivers also learn to consciously relax and reduce their metabolic rate during static apnea. This is more of a behavioral adaptation but has physiological outcomes. By staying calm and minimizing movement, the diver’s muscles use less ATP and produce less CO₂. There is evidence that elite breath-hold divers have a lower resting metabolic rate and can reduce cardiac output on command (Patrician et al., 2021). The classic “diving reflex” contributes here: bradycardia (slowed heart rate) and peripheral vasoconstriction occur reflexively during apnea, which conserves oxygen for vital organs and reduces oxygen demand of muscles . This reflex, which becomes more pronounced with training, means the body’s overall CO₂ production is curtailed. Essentially, the diver’s body enters a quasi-hibernation for the duration of the dive – heart rate can drop by over 50%, and blood flow to muscles is shunted, forcing them to rely on internal O₂ stores and efficient metabolism . This state extends the time before critical CO₂ levels are reached.</li>
							<li>Brain metabolic adaptations: Perhaps most striking is how the brain of trained freedivers adapts. The brain is highly sensitive to both hypoxia and hypercapnia. However, an MRI spectroscopy study by Keil et al. (AJNR Am. J. Neuroradiology, 2018; DOI: 10.3174/ajnr.A5790) showed that during a 5-minute maximal breath-hold, experienced freedivers’ brains maintained aerobic metabolism even when systemic oxygen was very low and CO₂ very high. They found that while venous blood lactate rose ~18% in these dives, cerebral lactate did not rise above normal levels – the brain was not resorting to anaerobic metabolism to any significant degree. Additionally, high-energy phosphates (like phosphocreatine) in the brain were preserved much better than one would expect under severe hypoxemia. This suggests that the brains of trained divers can sustain oxidative metabolism and resist acidosis in extreme conditions. Several factors may contribute to this: enhanced cerebral blood flow (discussed next), efficient use of substrates, and possibly increased tolerance to elevated CO₂ at the neural level (neurons continuing to function in high CO₂ where untrained individuals might lose consciousness). There is also evidence that repeated apneas induce anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory adaptations that protect the brain from reperfusion injury and oxidative stress (Mrakic-Sposta et al., Front. Physiol., 2019), which could indirectly support metabolic stability.</li>
						</ul>	
						In summary, CO₂ tolerance training results in a suite of cellular-level adaptations: higher myoglobin and mitochondrial content in muscle, greater buffer capacity, and an overall shift to a metabolism that prioritizes aerobic pathways. This means that for a given duration of apnea, a trained diver will produce less lactic acid and thus less “additional” CO₂ from acid buffering than an untrained person. Their tissues consume oxygen frugally, and critical organs like the brain are better shielded from hypoxic and hypercapnic stress, continuing to function aerobically longer. These changes all reduce the rate of internal CO₂ generation and help stabilize internal pH, buying time during breath-hold.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Cerebrovascular Adaptations to Hypercapnia</strong><br>
						<br>
						The brain’s blood supply is finely tuned to changes in CO₂ – in fact, CO₂ is a powerful vasodilator in cerebral vessels. Freediving training appears to harness and refine this response to protect the brain from both hypoxia and hypercapnia. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) refers to how blood vessels in the brain dilate or constrict in response to changes in CO₂ or O₂. In elite freedivers, studies have found unique cerebrovascular responses during apnea that differ from untrained individuals.<br>
						<br>
						A 2018 neuroimaging study by Keil et al. (AJNR Am. J. Neuroradiol., 2018) used arterial spin labeling MRI to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in freedivers during a prolonged breath-hold. They observed that during the early phase of apnea, divers’ CBF was kept nearly constant, and then in the late phase (when CO₂ was very high and O₂ very low) CBF dramatically increased (~+52% in the late phase). This indicates a well-calibrated cerebrovascular reaction: rather than an early, steep rise in blood flow (which could cause blackouts or headaches), the divers’ brains initially maintain steady perfusion, conserving the vascular reserve for when it’s truly needed. Then, as CO₂ and hypoxia reach extreme levels near the breakpoint of the dive, the cerebral arteries dilate strongly to boost O₂ delivery and CO₂ removal from the brain. By timing the vasodilatory response to the latter part of the apnea, the brain gets an “oxygen flush” right when stores are almost exhausted. This controlled response likely helps avoid premature symptoms and prolong safe breath-hold duration.<br>
						<br>
						Interestingly, the same study noted regional differences in cerebrovascular adaptation: arteries supplying the front of the brain (anterior circulation) behaved differently than those in the back (posterior circulation). During late apnea, blood flow in the middle cerebral artery (feeding the forebrain) was significantly higher than in the posterior cerebral artery (feeding the occipital region). This suggests the body prioritizes critical areas (perhaps those controlling consciousness) when resources are low. Over the long term, there is evidence for structural or baseline functional changes as well: Keil et al. reported that divers with more lifetime breath-hold experience had slightly lower baseline CBF in white matter (on the order of a 0.6 mL/100g/min reduction per 1000 breath-holds performed)  . This might imply a chronic adaptation where the brain becomes more efficient or tolerant of lower blood flow, perhaps as a result of repeated hypoperfusion during training. It could also reflect a tolerance to higher CO₂ – if the brain can operate safely at higher CO₂, it doesn’t need to hyperventilate (and drive down CO₂) to maintain normal function, which correlates with a lower resting CBF.<br>
						<br>
						From a mechanistic standpoint, hypercapnia-driven vasodilation is a double-edged sword: it ensures oxygen delivery but also can raise intracranial pressure. Freedivers likely adapt to tolerate the sensations of hypercapnia (e.g. lightheadedness from vasodilation) and may have vascular smooth muscle that responds optimally. An efficient CVR means that as CO₂ climbs, cerebral vessels dilate just enough to flush CO₂ and deliver O₂ without overshooting. A 2020 study in Frontiers in Physiology noted that breath-hold induced increases in CBF help maintain aerobic brain metabolism, preventing an excessive accumulation of lactate in the brain. This aligns with the earlier point that cerebral lactate stays low – effective blood flow and oxygenation are preserving oxidative metabolism in the brain. Additionally, there is evidence that apnea training might subtly impair dynamic cerebral autoregulation in response to blood pressure changes (Mark et al., J. Appl. Physiol., 2019), meaning divers’ brains rely more on CO₂-driven control than pressure-driven control. While termed an “impairment,” this could be viewed as the cerebrovascular system shifting its priorities – tolerating larger blood pressure swings in order to keep blood flow tied to CO₂ levels appropriately.<br>
						<br>
						Another adaptation is the tolerance to high CO₂ itself at the neuronal level. Hypercapnia normally causes confusion or panic at a certain point. Divers through experience learn mental techniques to remain calm under high CO₂. Some studies using EEG and cognitive tests (Ridgway & McFarland, 2020) indicate that freedivers can maintain cognitive function at CO₂ levels that would severely impair untrained individuals. This could be partly due to the stable cerebral perfusion, but also due to neural adaptations (e.g. neurons might increase expression of pH-regulating proteins, or there may be enhanced neuroprotective pathways activated by repeated mild CO₂ exposure).<br>
						<br>
						In summary, the cerebrovascular system in trained freedivers is highly adapted to cope with hypercapnia. Blood vessels dilate in a controlled manner to safeguard the brain: early in a dive the response is tempered, and late in a dive it is amplified to deliver a surge of oxygen where needed. This ensures the brain stays functional despite rising CO₂ and falling O₂. Over years of training, divers may even develop long-term shifts in cerebrovascular regulation (e.g. lower baseline blood flow and a reliance on CO₂-mediated flow adjustments). Combined with neural and psychological conditioning, these vascular adaptations help freedivers remain conscious and lucid far into what would otherwise be dangerous hypercapnia.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
						<br>
						Freediving and systematic CO₂ tolerance training induce a remarkable suite of biological adaptations that collectively enable humans to survive – and even perform – under extreme CO₂ levels. Through enhanced bicarbonate buffering, the blood chemistry is stabilized and acidosis is kept in check during long breath-holds. Through chemoreflex desensitization, the respiratory center learns to tolerate higher CO₂ before signaling an emergency, extending the breath-hold breaking point. Adjustments in hemoglobin concentration and efficient use of the Bohr effect ensure that oxygen delivery is optimized when CO₂ is high, without fundamentally altering hemoglobin’s chemistry. At the cellular level, organs like muscle and brain develop greater metabolic efficiency, sustaining aerobic metabolism longer and reducing excess CO₂ production. Finally, cerebrovascular adaptations safeguard the brain’s function by finely tuning blood flow in response to CO₂. All of these changes are interrelated – for instance, blunted chemoreflexes allow CO₂ to rise more, which in turn enhances oxygen off-loading (Bohr effect) and drives cerebral vasodilation to protect the brain. In essence, the trained freediver’s body becomes a carefully calibrated system that can balance the blood gases under conditions that would severely disturb homeostasis in an untrained person. This balancing act allows freedivers to achieve feats like five- to ten-minute breath-holds and deep dives, while avoiding complications from hypercapnia. Current peer-reviewed research, from human trials to animal models, continues to unravel these adaptations, not only inspiring athletic achievement but also informing medical science (for example, insights into sleep apnea, COPD, and hypoxia tolerance). The emerging picture affirms that with repeated exposure and training, the human body can significantly expand its tolerance to high CO₂ through both acute physiological responses and chronic adaptations  – a testament to human physiological plasticity.<br>
