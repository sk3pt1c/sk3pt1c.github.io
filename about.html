						<h3 style="text-align: center;">Why "Free Flow"</h3>
						<p>
							The state of flow is an idea in positive psychology made popular by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. <br>
							It is similar to what is described as being "in the zone" or "locked in" in sports.<br>
							The idea is that we are doing an activity that is difficult enough and where our skills are developed enough to put us in that state.<br>
							If our skills are low and the activity is difficult, we would give up. If on the other hand our skills are developed but the activity
							is easy, we would be bored. <br>
							So we need to find that "sweet spot" where our skills are developed enough and the activity is difficult enough
							to put us in that flow state where we are acutely focused on it and it alone.<br>
							The thinking is that when we are in this state of flow, we as individuals can kind of disappear and all that is left is a hyper focus
							on the activity itself and performing it to the best of our abilities.<br>
							There is very little space in the mind for other thoughts and feelings as all our "processing power" is taken up by the activity itself.<br>
							Naturally, freediving can lend itself to getting us into a state of flow, if approached properly and not with a focus on numbers and performances.<br>
							Our focus needs to be on achieving this state of effortless focus so that we can have graceful peaceful dives and happy feelings when we surface.<br>
							So the idea was "freedom through flow activities", which I shortened to "Free Flow".
						</p>
						<h3 style="text-align: center;">My story</h3>
						<p>
							I was born and raised in Athens, but since my father is from Zakynthos, I have been in the water all my life.<br>
							I would follow my dad spearfishing since I was 4 or 5 years old, sometimes being out in the water for hours on end.<br>
							So, I've always had a loving and respectful relationship with the sea and felt calm just by getting in the water.<br>
							After watching the Big Blue I started being more interested in freediving and would always have my mask, snorkel and fins with me whenever I would go to water.<br>
							My studies and work were in web development and I was doing this in Athens until I saw some people freediving.<br>
							Turns out it was an Apnea Academy instructor teaching, so we had a chat and I started preparing for my first course.<br>
							After completing the course I became friends with Dimitris Koumoulos, who helped me immensely with training and overall guidance, I owe him a lot!<br>
							So, I made the decision to drop everything, move to Zakynthos and live in my grandparents home to be able to be close to the water and train to be an instructor.<br>
							This happened in 2018 in Tenerife under the guidance of the one and only Umberto Pelizzari (you can find me on AA's <a href="https://apnea.academy/en/instructors/">list of instructors</a>).<br>
							I have also created the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/freedivingscience">Freediving Science" Facebook group</a> which has over 10k users now and is a great place to discuss research, technique etc.<br>
							In the fall of 2019 I became a <a href="http://www.apnea-academy-kad.com">KAD</a> (Kids As Dolhpins) instructor, which is an amazing program with a 30 year experience that teaches freediving to children.<br>
							Since 2020, I am also an Advanced First Aid Instructor with <a href="https://www.rescuetraining.gr" target="_blank">Rescue Training International</a>, you can see available courses I can teach and certify in the <a href="services.html">services</a> section.<br>
							Since 2024, I have also become a <a href="https://www.sharequalization.com/">SHARE Equalization</a> instructor, offering online equalization courses. I am very thankful to Federico Mana for sharing his knowledge on this topic with me!<br>
							Since 2025, I am also an equalization instructor with Apnea Academy, trying to further my specialization into the world of freediving equalization!
						</p>
						<h3 style="text-align: center;">About Zakynthos &amp; diving here.</h3>
						<p>
							<div style="text-align: center;">Zakynthos is a beautiful island in the Ionian Sea in Greece, where I live and teach.</div><br>
							It is a very popular destination for its east and south coasts that are full of beautiful sandy beaches and 
							clear waters - and home to the largest loggerhead sea turtles in the Mediterranean - and for its dramatic west coast
							that features sharp cliffs and breath taking sunsets.<br>
							<br>
							<div style="text-align: center;">
								<strong>Freediving here is done from shore and the depth limit is 50m.<br>
								<br>
								Also, on the buoy, you must have a small bottle of water attached to a string, pool noodles, pillows etc are not allowed.<br>
								<br>
								You may also take your fins off if you want to do a no fins dive but no second pair of bifins or monofin are allowed, if you want to
								dive with special bifins or a monofin, you have to use them throughout the session.</strong>
							</div>
							<br>
							We dive using a buoy and a bottom weight that in most cases will be touching the bottom of the sea so you need to be 
							aware and dive with one hand up on the rope to feel the stopper, otherwise you might hit the bottom or some rocks.<br>
							You need to be fairly fit to be able to go up and down steps and some rocks to reach the dive sites and tight shoes are required.<br>
						</p>
						<h3 style="text-align: center;">Gear I use</h3>
						<p>
							One of the most common questions new(er) freedivers have is what gear to use, so I thought I'd add my 2 cents here and share what I use.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Mask</strong>: <a href="https://www.diveshop.gr/index.php/product744.html">Technisub Micromask</a> - this is by far the best mask I've used, very durable, 
							high quality mask (make sure to get the original and not a clone/copy).<br> 
							<strong>Snorkel</strong>: <a href="https://www.diveshop.gr/index.php/beuchat-activa-tubair.html">Beuchat Activa Tubair</a> - or any curved soft snorkel like this.<br>
							<strong>Wetsuits</strong>: I work with <a href="https://www.g-and-sea.com">G & Sea</a>, a Greek wetsuit manufacturer that makes tailored wetsuits using only the finest Yamamoto materials, 
							send us an <a href="mailto:gilda@g-and-sea.com">email</a> or a <a href="http://m.me/gandsea">message over at our Facebook page</a> to quote you on your suit, you won't regret it.<br>
							<strong>Fins</strong>: I use fins by <a href="https://www.deepdivextasy.com/en/">Deep Dive Xtasy</a> and am very happy with them! I can also offer exclusive pricing on them so hit me up!<br>
							<strong>Noseclip</strong>: <a href="https://www.octopusfreediving.com/collections/frontpage/products/copy-of-grey-noseclip-4">Octopus</a> ftw :)<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Insurance</strong>: DAN Europe is the best dive insurance you can get, click <a href="https://www.daneurope.org/en/buy-dive-insurance#!/partnerCode=779653">here</a> to get your insurance!
